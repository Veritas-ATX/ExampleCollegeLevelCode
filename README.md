# ExampleCollegeLevelCode
Contained within this repository are sets of example code that I have worked on during my time at Princeton University or during summer internships. These are intended to provide an idea of what I have worked on in the past and to exemplify my programming style.

"CodeFlexibilityRange" contains example code from my time at the Fraunhofer IML. It helps produce PCI (process capability index) scores to quantify the performance of elements of a supply chain. Reproduced here with permission from my program coordinator, Saskia Sardesai-Wagner. 

"Portfolio Simulation" contains example code from my ORF 311: Stochastic Optimization and Machine Learning in Finance course. It simulates the performance of a portfolio of stocks to generate rough ideas of when someone might reach a desired level of wealth for retirement. 

"QueueExample_MonteCarlo" contains example code from my ORF 409: Monte Carlo Simulations course. In this file, a queue is simulated to represent arrival times at an establishment or process (e.g. order fulfillment) and outputs various metrics of the queue. 

"SeamCarver" contains example code from my COS 226: Data Structures and Algorithms course. It was part of an assignment to resize images while keeping as many relevant pixels as possible.
